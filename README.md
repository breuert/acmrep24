# Now that your system has been reproduced, what does this mean for the users?

This repository accompanies our short paper submission. It features all of the code and resources to reproduce the experimental results. The [Jupyter notebook](./main.ipynb) can be run with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/breuert/acmrep24/blob/main/main.ipynb) or from within a local Python environment. The notebook is self-contained, as it install the dependencies and fetches the data resources from the web. The subdirectories in this repository contain compressed archives with the experimental results.
